# BSSCalculator
Based on the calculations for the BSS wiki this is my passion project where I challenge myself to get out of my comfort zone and code formulas and automate information with a full JSON save file including all bees and stats  

This project consists of two main parts, the calculations and storing of each bee with their respective attributes  

[ ] Calculations Progress: 1/5
[x] Functioning JSON file which gets serialized and deserialized into my class objects.

# Json Example (only common, rare and epic bees added for now)
## Example of one bee and their stats
```json
[
  {
    "BeeEnum": { "Key": 1, "Value": "Basic" },
    "Rarity": 0,
    "Colour": 0,
    "BaseEnergy": 20,
    "BaseSpeed": 14,
    "BaseAttack": 1,
    "BaseGather": 10,
    "BaseProduction": 80
  }
]

```
